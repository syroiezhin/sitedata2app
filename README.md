# <p id="UP">Do you want to create your first macbook app file?</p>

> To create our first working project using py2app for macbook, we will use a ready-made template called "tk-wbs-ip.py" written using only the Tkinter library to create a simple and useful interface. Then we use it in a more advanced program that extracts information about the owner of the entered domain (getting the site's IP address).

> Let's start by reviewing this template, which we will need in the project.
- [X] Create a window; Assign an icon to it; Fill the background of the window with gray color; Assign the name of the window, which is displayed in the middle at the top of the window; Set the window size; Prohibit changing window sizes with the last command.
```python
win = tk.Tk()
win.iconphoto(False,tk.PhotoImage(file='icon.png'))
win.config(bg='#2f3f4f')
win.title('DATA SEARCH BY URL')
win.geometry(f"{wdth}x{hght}")
win.resizable(False,False)
```
