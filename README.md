# <p id="UP">Do you want to create your first macbook app file?</p>

> To create our first working project using py2app for macbook, we will use a ready-made template called "tk-wbs-ip.py" written using only the Tkinter library to create a simple and useful interface. Then we use it in a more advanced program that extracts information about the owner of the entered domain (getting the site's IP address).
